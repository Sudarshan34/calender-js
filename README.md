Dear Team,

I have used query selectors to get the elements from html to js and I have created a  object called currentDate to get the current date and time,toLocaleDateString method to format the date readable format

month.textContent is set to the full name of the current month.
day.textContent is set to the full name of the current day of the week.
date.textContent is set to the current day of the month.
year.textContent is set to the current year.

These changes are reflected in the HTML elements on the page, it will update  the calendar with the current date information.
